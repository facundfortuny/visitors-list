# Visitors List

## Task description:

It is necessary to create a simple application using Angular whose task is to generate and update the list of visitors.

When the application is opened the list is empty and by clicking on ""Add new"" the input control for entering the person's name and email appears.

When you click ""Save"" the input should no longer be displayed and instead should be the person's name and the corresponding email in text form.

The update happens when that person is clicked and instead of text we have input control again.

It is possible to enter an unlimited number of people. It is necessary to disable the addition / rescue of visitors without valid data and display the appropriate message to the user of the application.
